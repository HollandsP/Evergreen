**Recommended Timeline**:
- **Week 1**: Fix blocking issues (TypeScript, tests, server)
- **Week 2-3**: Implement essential features (monitoring, error handling, security)
- **Week 4+**: Production deployment with limited rollout

**Success Metrics Post-Launch**:
- Build success rate: 100%
- Test pass rate: >90%
- User completion rate: >70%
- API cost per video: <$5.00
- Generation time: <10 minutes per video
