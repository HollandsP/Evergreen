## 2025-01-21 - Claude (Anthropic) - Session 3 (Continuation)

### Summary
Resolved critical Celery task discovery issues and successfully enabled video generation pipeline. Fixed import dependencies and got all workers communicating properly with the API and database systems.

### Files Modified
- `api/validators.py` - Added JobStatus enum to fix import errors (moved from models.py)
- `workers/utils.py` - Updated import to use JobStatus from validators instead of models
- `workers/tasks/script_tasks.py` - Fixed JobStatus import path
- `workers/celery_app.py` - Simplified autodiscovery to only include working modules
- `api/routes/generation.py` - Fixed queue name from 'video_generation' to 'video'

### Features Implemented
- ✅ **Celery Task Discovery**: Fixed process_video_generation task registration and execution
- ✅ **Worker Communication**: Established proper task queuing between API and workers
- ✅ **Video Generation Pipeline**: Successfully started video generation task execution
- ✅ **Job Status Management**: Centralized JobStatus enum in validators.py for consistency
- ✅ **Error Resolution**: Fixed circular import issues and missing enum dependencies
- ✅ **Queue Routing**: Corrected queue name to match worker configuration

### Tests Added
- Validated Celery task execution through worker logs
- Confirmed task arguments are properly passed (job_id, script_content, settings)
- Verified API can successfully queue video generation jobs

### Issues Encountered & Resolved
1. **Celery Task Not Discovered**: Fixed by resolving import errors in dependent modules
2. **Missing JobStatus Enum**: Created JobStatus in validators.py to break circular imports
