- ❌ **2-Minute Showcase Video**: No video was generated despite multiple attempts
- ❌ **API Integration**: Database connection issues prevented API tests
- ❌ **Direct Testing**: Import errors and module issues in worker

### Tests Added (All Failed)
- test_2min_showcase.py - Failed due to PostgreSQL connection issues
- test_complete_generation.py - Ran but only created error placeholder file
- test_simple_direct.py - Verified class exists but no actual functionality
- Multiple other test attempts with various errors

### Issues Encountered (NOT Resolved)
1. **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL port 5432 conflict - never fixed
2. **Git Authentication**: GitHub token expired - unable to push
3. **Import Errors**: Module 'workers.effects' not found
4. **API Authentication**: 500 errors prevented any API testing
5. **FFmpeg Assembly**: All attempts failed - no valid media files
6. **Invalid API Keys**: ElevenLabs returned 401 errors
7. **Empty Files**: All generated files were 0KB or error messages

### What Actually Happened
- **VideoComposer Class**: Added to code but never successfully assembled a video
- **Timeline Building**: Function exists but was never tested with real files
- **Script Parsing**: Worked to extract 4 scenes from test script
- **Voice Generation**: Failed - invalid API key (all files 0KB)
- **Terminal UI**: Failed - module not found errors
- **Visual Generation**: Created 5MB placeholder files (not real videos)
- **FFmpeg Assembly**: Failed completely - "Invalid data found when processing input"
- **Final Output**: 97-byte error message file, not a video

### Current Pipeline Status
- ✅ Script parsing with ScriptParser - Only thing that worked
- ❌ Voice synthesis (ElevenLabs) - Failed with 401 errors
- ❌ Terminal UI animations - Module not found
- ❌ Visual scene generation (Runway) - Only stub placeholders
- ❌ Video assembly (FFmpeg) - Complete failure
- ❌ Working video output - Nothing produced

### Reality Check
**No working video was produced**. The test that claimed success only showed that the VideoComposer class could be instantiated and that the code attempted to run, but every single media generation and assembly step failed. The final "video" file was just an error message.

### Next Steps
1. **Fix module imports** - workers.effects not found
2. **Provide valid API keys** - Current keys are invalid
3. **Create real test media** - Use FFmpeg to generate test patterns
4. **Fix database issues** - PostgreSQL port conflicts
5. **Test with valid files** - Current approach with empty files cannot work

### Recommendations for Next Agent
- Don't trust the current test results - nothing actually works
- Need to create real media files for testing (not empty placeholders)
- Fix the basic infrastructure issues before attempting integration
- Consider using FFmpeg test patterns instead of relying on external APIs
- The VideoComposer code exists but has never successfully assembled anything

### Time Spent
- Estimated time: 4 hours (mostly debugging failures and creating non-working tests)

## 2025-07-22 - Claude (Anthropic) - Session 15 (Image-to-Video Workflow Analysis)

### Summary
Following user directive to "analyze first, then plan, and then confirm with me, then build/fix", conducted comprehensive analysis of the image-to-video workflow. Discovered that while the core infrastructure exists (images are passed to video generation), the user experience is severely lacking around prompt management and the workflow visibility.

### Files Modified
- `AGENT_WORK_LOG.md` - Updated with Session 15 analysis

### Files Analyzed
- `web/components/layout/StageNavigation.tsx` - Found all 5 stages defined but image stage marked as disabled
- `web/pages/production/index.tsx` - Discovered auto-redirect to script stage (bypassing navigation)
- `web/lib/production-state.ts` - Confirmed proper production state management exists
- `web/pages/api/videos/generate.ts` - Verified imageUrl parameter exists and is used

### Features Analyzed
- ✅ **Infrastructure Exists**: Image URLs are properly passed to video generation
- ❌ **Navigation Broken**: All stages except script are marked as disabled/unavailable
- ❌ **Prompt Workflow**: Video prompts are separate from image prompts (no inheritance)
- ❌ **User Visibility**: No way to see or navigate to image generation stage

### Issues Identified
1. **Navigation Problem**: DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_STAGES marks all stages except script as disabled
2. **Auto-Redirect**: Production index immediately redirects to script, preventing stage selection
3. **Prompt Disconnect**: Image prompts don't flow to video prompts - users must rewrite
4. **Missing UI Elements**: No image preview or prompt editing in video generation stage
5. **Mock Implementation**: Video generation API returns fake URLs, not real videos

### Analysis Findings
The core issue isn't missing infrastructure - it's missing user experience:
- Image-to-video data flow exists in the code
- The problem is users can't access the image generation stage
- Even if they could, the prompt workflow is disconnected
- The UI doesn't show the relationship between images and videos

### Next Steps
Based on analysis, need to create implementation plan for:
1. Enable all navigation stages (fix DEFAULT_PRODUCTION_STAGES)
2. Remove auto-redirect from production index
3. Create prompt inheritance from images to videos
4. Add image preview and prompt editing in video stage
5. Implement real RunwayML API integration

### Recommendations for Next Agent
- The infrastructure is there but the UX is broken
- Focus on navigation and workflow visibility first
- Then enhance the prompt management system
- User needs to confirm the plan before implementation

### Time Spent
- Estimated time: 0.5 hours (analysis only per user directive)
