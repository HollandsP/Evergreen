> /sc:troubleshoot is running… read all work logs and project files. Yesterday I aSKED you to get this app actually working. I emphasized that I want the main features to be the focus, and make efforts to reduce bloat in the project and leave the root folder orgaNIZED AND ALL WORK LOGS     
 UPDATED and commited to github. We planned it in phases, everything went well until phase 4. the first 3 phases were followed correctly, however the 4th phase completely re-bloated the project and made the focus about a bunch of extra bullshit features i never asked for. this is
ridiculous, make my pipeline fucking work! this was my original message to them, you can see how it was implemented if you read all pertinent/related files. I just want to use the pipeline! :whole project needs to be reviewed. Without changing the features or design of pipeline, find a     
 way  │
│   to simplify the project overall. This was meant to be more of a bespoke tool that I could personally use to      │
│   make the best quality AI youtube videos, and start a channel. I have worked with numerous agents to get to this  │
│   point, and i think the plan is what i want(ie. dont change the plan overall). However, I feel the                │
│   implementation has not been very thorough, and thus the project has many errors/bugs. I want you to hone in on   │
│   the core features, and ensure they are working as good as they can be. Reduce bloat and additional features I    │
│   never asked for. After reviewing work logs and other context, make a plan and ask me for confirmation. At that   │
│   point I will give confirmation, and you can begin implementation. After implementation Cleanup the home folder   │
│   when you are finished. Then update agent_work_log.md and commit changes to github. ***IMPORTANT*** DO THIS FOR   │
│   3 CYCLES/ITERATIONS. THE IDEA BEING, THAT EACH CYCLE CAN BUILD ON THE PROGRESS OF THE LAST, AND HOPEFULLY LEAD   │
│   TO A MUCH BETTER FINAL PRODUCT. END GOAL IS A WORKING PIPELINE THAT I CAN USE(THROUGH WEB UI ) TO CREATE         │

✻ Thinking…

  The user is frustrated about their AI video pipeline project. They've mentioned that:

  1. They asked for the app to be made working yesterday
  2. They want focus on main features and reduction of bloat
  3. The project was being done in phases, and phases 1-3 went well but phase 4 added unwanted features
  4. They want a simple, bespoke tool for creating YouTube videos (shorts to 10 minute stories)
  5. The implementation has been poor with many errors/bugs
  6. They want me to:
    - Review all work logs and project files
    - Focus on core features
    - Remove bloat and unwanted features
    - Clean up the home folder
    - Update agent_work_log.md
    - Commit to GitHub
    - Do this for 3 cycles/iterations

  Let me start by reading the key files to understand the current state of the project.

● I'll help you diagnose and fix the issues with your AI video pipeline. Let me start by reviewing the work logs and understanding the current state of the project.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Read and analyze all agent work logs to understand project history
     ☐ Review CLAUDE.md and README.md to understand project requirements
     ☐ Identify bloat and unnecessary features added in Phase 4
     ☐ Create streamlined implementation plan focusing on core features
     ☐ Get user confirmation on the plan
     ☐ Execute Cycle 1: Core functionality fixes
     ☐ Execute Cycle 2: Build on Cycle 1 improvements
     ☐ Execute Cycle 3: Final polish and optimization

✻ Thinking…

  Let me start by reading the agent work log to understand the project history and what happened in Phase 4.

● Read(AGENT_WORK_LOG.md)
  ⎿  Error: File content (45210 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use offset and limit parameters to read specific portions of the file, or use the GrepTool to search for specific content.

✻ Thinking…

  The work log is too large. Let me read the last portions to see the most recent activity.

● Read(AGENT_WORK_LOG.md)
  ⎿  Read 1000 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me continue reading the agent work log to get more context on the recent work.

● Task(Analyze full project state)
  ⎿  Done (19 tool uses · 83.1k tokens · 2m 39.2s)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a clear understanding of the issues. Let me update the todo list with specific tasks for the diagnosis phase and then review critical files to understand the core pipeline status better.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read and analyze all agent work logs to understand project history
     ☒ Review CLAUDE.md and README.md to understand project requirements
     ☒ Identify bloat and unnecessary features added in Phase 4
     ☐ Create streamlined implementation plan focusing on core features
     ☐ Get user confirmation on the plan
     ☐ Execute Cycle 1: Core functionality fixes
     ☐ Execute Cycle 2: Build on Cycle 1 improvements
     ☐ Execute Cycle 3: Final polish and optimization

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check what exactly the current state of the web UI is and what the user's workflow should look like by examining key files.

● Read(web/pages/index.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 638 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I see the current index page is focused on image generation, not the full pipeline workflow the user wants. Let me check what stages are implemented by looking at the StageNavigation component mentioned in the git status.

● Read(web/components/layout/StageNavigation.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 260 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Good! I can see the stages exist. Let me check if the production pages exist to see if the workflow is implemented.

● List(web/pages/production)
  ⎿  Listed 11 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Good, the production pages exist. Let me check if there's a newer entry point that uses the full pipeline workflow instead of the simple index.tsx that focuses on image generation.

● Read(web/pages/production/index.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 112 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me check the web socket implementation status to understand what's missing.

● Read(web/lib/websocket.ts)
  ⎿  Read 235 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check if there's a WebSocket server implementation in the API folder.

● Search(pattern: "socket", path: "web/pages/api", glob: "*.ts")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check the socket.ts file to see if it's implemented.

● Read(web/pages/api/socket.ts)
  ⎿  Read 157 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to check if RunwayML integration is actually working. Let me check the video generation endpoint.

● Read(web/pages/api/videos/generate.ts)
  ⎿  Read 329 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check if the RunwayML client implementation is complete or just a stub.

● Read(web/lib/runway-client.ts)
  ⎿  Read 372 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Good! The RunwayML client appears to be fully implemented. Now I need to create a comprehensive plan to fix this pipeline. Based on my analysis:

  Core Issues:
  1. Too many unnecessary features added in Phase 4 (30+ new components/services)
  2. Pipeline exists but isn't seamlessly integrated
  3. Missing backend WebSocket server for real-time updates
  4. AI video editor needs backend connection
  5. YouTube upload not implemented
  6. Root folder cluttered with extra files

  Core Features That Should Work:
  1. Script upload and scene division ✅
  2. Image generation with DALL-E 3 ✅
  3. Audio generation with ElevenLabs ✅
  4. Video generation with RunwayML (needs testing)
  5. AI video editing (needs backend integration)
  6. Export/YouTube upload (missing)

  Let me finalize the plan.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read and analyze all agent work logs to understand project history
     ☒ Review CLAUDE.md and README.md to understand project requirements
     ☒ Identify bloat and unnecessary features added in Phase 4
     ☒ Create streamlined implementation plan focusing on core features
     ☐ Get user confirmation on the plan
     ☐ Execute Cycle 1: Core functionality fixes
     ☐ Execute Cycle 2: Build on Cycle 1 improvements
     ☐ Execute Cycle 3: Final polish and optimization

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll present the plan to the user for confirmation.

● 📋 Streamlined Implementation Plan - 3 Cycles to Working Pipeline

  I've completed my analysis. The project has a solid foundation but Phase 4 added massive bloat (30+ unnecessary features). Here's my plan to get your core pipeline working:

  🎯 Core Pipeline Focus

  Your Vision: Script → Scenes → Images → Audio → Video → Edit → Export/YouTube

  🔴 CYCLE 1: Fix Core Pipeline Flow (Remove Bloat & Connect Services)

  1. Remove 30+ Unnecessary Features:
    - Delete advanced editing components (Timeline.tsx, CollaborativeEditor.tsx, etc.)
    - Remove unnecessary backend services (ai_color_enhancer.py, video_stabilizer.py, etc.)
    - Clean up test files for features you didn't request
  2. Fix Pipeline Integration:
    - Connect production pages properly (/production/script → audio → images → videos → assembly)
    - Implement backend WebSocket server for real-time updates
    - Fix file organization and folder structure persistence
    - Ensure scene metadata flows through all stages
  3. Test Core Features:
    - Verify RunwayML image-to-video actually works with API key
    - Test complete flow from script upload to video generation
    - Fix any broken connections between stages

  🟡 CYCLE 2: AI Video Editor & Export (Core Functionality)

  1. Complete AI Video Editor:
    - Connect chat interface to backend Python video editor
    - Implement basic commands: cut, fade, transitions, combine scenes
    - Use existing MoviePy integration (no new features)
    - Save edited videos to proper export folder
  2. Export & Download:
    - Simple export to MP4 with all scenes combined
    - Download button for final video
    - Basic metadata (title, description) for YouTube
  3. Basic YouTube Upload (if time permits):
    - Simple OAuth flow
    - Upload with title/description
    - No fancy features

  🟢 CYCLE 3: Polish & Reliability (Make It Actually Work)

  1. Error Handling:
    - Graceful failures with clear error messages
    - Retry logic for API calls
    - Progress saving to localStorage
  2. UI Cleanup:
    - Remove references to deleted features
    - Ensure dark mode consistency
    - Clear navigation between stages
    - Simple, working interface
  3. Documentation & Cleanup:
    - Update README with actual working features
    - Clean root folder (move test files, remove duplicates)
    - Update agent work log
    - Final testing of complete pipeline

  📊 What I'll Focus On:

  ✅ Making existing features work seamlessly✅ Removing bloat and unnecessary complexity✅ Simple, reliable pipeline you can actually use✅ Clear folder structure and organization

  ❌ What I Won't Do:

  ❌ Add new features❌ Implement professional video editing UI❌ Create complex collaboration systems❌ Build advanced AI analysis tools

  Estimated Result: A working pipeline where you can upload a script, generate scenes with images/audio/video, do basic AI editing, and export a YouTube-ready video.

  Shall I proceed with this plan?
