## ðŸš€ Progress Monitoring UIs

### Flower (Celery Monitor) - http://localhost:5556
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin
- Real-time task progress bars
- Worker health monitoring
- Task success/failure tracking

### API Documentation - http://localhost:8000/docs
- Interactive API testing
- Submit video generation requests
- Check task status by ID

## ðŸŽ¬ Ready to Generate Video

Once services are running, you can:

1. Open Flower at http://localhost:5556 to watch progress
2. Run `python3 generate_video.py` to start the video generation
3. Watch as it progresses through:
   - Script parsing
   - Voice generation (ElevenLabs)
   - Visual generation (Runway)
   - Video assembly (FFmpeg)
   - S3 upload

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

Docker services are being started. The API had some dependency issues that have been fixed:
- Added pydantic-settings
- Added email-validator
- Fixed SQLAlchemy reserved word conflict
- Fixed database URL type conversion

Once the build completes and services start, you'll be able to access the monitoring UIs and begin video generation.
