# 🚀 GitHub Repository Restructuring Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Local repository: `Evergreen` (correctly named)
- ✅ All improvements committed (161 files, 40,170+ insertions)
- ❌ Remote still points to: `ai-content-pipeline`

## 📋 Steps to Complete Repository Restructuring

### Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `Evergreen`
3. **Description**: `Enterprise-grade AI video generation pipeline - automated content creation from scripts to cinematic videos`
4. **Visibility**: Private or Public (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Update Remote Origin (Run these commands)
```bash
# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/HollandsP/Evergreen.git

# Verify remote is set correctly
git remote -v
```

### Step 3: Push to New Repository
```bash
# Push all branches and tags to new repository
git push -u origin main

# Push all tags if any
git push --tags
```

### Step 4: Verify New Repository
1. Visit: https://github.com/HollandsP/Evergreen
2. Confirm all files and commit history are present
3. Check that the latest commit shows the transformation summary

### Step 5: Delete Old Repository (OPTIONAL)
**⚠️ WARNING: This action cannot be undone!**

1. Go to: https://github.com/HollandsP/ai-content-pipeline
2. Settings → General → Danger Zone → Delete this repository
3. Type the repository name to confirm deletion

## 🎯 Alternative: Rename Existing Repository

If you prefer to rename the existing repository instead:

1. Go to: https://github.com/HollandsP/ai-content-pipeline
2. Settings → General → Repository name
3. Change from `ai-content-pipeline` to `Evergreen`
4. Click **"Rename"**
5. Update local remote:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/HollandsP/Evergreen.git
   ```

## ✅ Final Verification

After completing either approach:

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Verify remote URL
git remote -v

# Test push (should work without issues)
git push
```

## 🎉 Expected Result

- ✅ Repository accessible at: `https://github.com/HollandsP/Evergreen`
- ✅ All 3-cycle improvements committed and visible
- ✅ Enterprise-grade platform ready for collaboration
- ✅ Clean repository structure with organized documentation
