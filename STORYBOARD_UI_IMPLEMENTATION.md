# Storyboard-First UI Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the storyboard-first UI architecture with dark mode design system for the Evergreen AI Video Pipeline project. The implementation includes a persistent visual storyboard that remains visible throughout all production stages.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **StoryboardHeader Component** (`/web/components/storyboard/StoryboardHeader.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Main storyboard container that displays all scenes
- **Features**:
  - Horizontal scrollable scene frames
  - Scene selection and navigation
  - Progress tracking indicators
  - Scene status visualization (empty, sketch, generated, video-ready, complete)
  - Responsive scroll controls

### 2. **StoryboardFrame Component** (`/web/components/storyboard/StoryboardFrame.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Individual scene frame with interactive capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Visual representation of each scene
  - Three input methods: Sketch, AI Generate, Upload
  - Status indicators for image, audio, and video assets
  - Click-to-select functionality
  - Scene metadata display (title, description)

### 3. **SketchTool Component** (`/web/components/storyboard/SketchTool.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Built-in drawing tool for creating scene sketches
- **Features**:
  - Full canvas drawing capabilities
  - Color picker with 8 preset colors
  - Adjustable brush sizes (1-12px)
  - Undo/Redo functionality
  - Clear canvas option
  - Save sketch as image data

### 4. **Dark Mode Theme Implementation**
- **Color Palette**:
  - Backgrounds: `zinc-950`, `zinc-900`, `zinc-800`
  - Borders: `zinc-700`, `zinc-800`
  - Text: `zinc-100` (primary), `zinc-300` (secondary), `zinc-400` (muted)
  - Accents: `emerald-600`, `emerald-400` (primary), `blue-600` (secondary)
  - Status Colors: Green, Red, Yellow, Purple variants with transparency

## UI/UX Improvements

### 1. **Stage Navigation Updates**
- Enabled all production stages (previously disabled)
- Updated to dark mode color scheme
- Visual feedback for active stage with emerald accent

### 2. **Persistent Storyboard**
- Storyboard remains sticky at top of interface
- Visible across all production stages
- Maintains scene selection state
- Shows real-time progress as assets are generated

### 3. **Layout Hierarchy**
```
Header (z-50, sticky top-0)
├── Logo and App Title
└── Connection Status

StoryboardHeader (z-40, sticky top-16)
├── Scene Frames (horizontal scroll)
├── Navigation Controls
└── Progress Indicators

StageNavigation (static)
├── Script Processing
├── Audio Generation
├── Image Generation
├── Video Generation
└── Final Assembly

Main Content Area
└── Stage-specific content
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Updates (`/web/styles/globals.css`)
- Updated all component classes for dark mode
- Modified color variables for zinc-based palette
- Updated status badges, buttons, inputs, cards
- Custom scrollbar styling for dark theme

### Component Integration
- Updated `ProductionLayout.tsx` to include StoryboardHeader
- Added scene state management hooks
- Integrated scene selection with production workflow
- Added mock scene data for development

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
interface Scene {
  id: string;
  number: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  prompt?: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  videoUrl?: string;
  audioUrl?: string;
  status: 'empty' | 'sketch' | 'generated' | 'video-ready' | 'complete';
  selected?: boolean;
}
```

## Usage Flow

1. **Scene Creation**: Users see empty storyboard frames representing script scenes
2. **Asset Generation**: Three options per frame:
   - **Sketch**: Open drawing tool to create custom visuals
   - **AI Generate**: Use AI to create images from prompts
   - **Upload**: Import existing images
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators show which assets are complete
4. **Scene Navigation**: Click any frame to jump to that scene's details
5. **Cross-Stage Persistence**: Storyboard remains visible during audio, video, and assembly stages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder scenes by dragging frames
2. **Batch Operations**: Select multiple frames for bulk actions
3. **Timeline View**: Alternative visualization showing temporal relationships
4. **Export Storyboard**: Save storyboard as PDF or image sequence
5. **Collaborative Features**: Real-time multi-user editing
6. **Version History**: Track changes to storyboard over time

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test storyboard persistence across all production stages
2. Verify scene selection state management
3. Test sketch tool on different screen sizes
4. Validate dark mode contrast ratios for accessibility
5. Test horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
6. Verify sticky positioning behavior during scroll

The implementation provides a strong foundation for the storyboard-first workflow while maintaining a modern, professional dark mode aesthetic that reduces eye strain during extended production sessions.
