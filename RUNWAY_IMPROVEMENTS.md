# RunwayML Integration Improvements

## Summary of Issues Found

After thorough analysis of the RunwayML integration, I identified several critical issues preventing the pipeline from utilizing RunwayML's full potential:

### 1. **Not Using the Actual RunwayML API**
- The current implementation was generating placeholder videos with FFmpeg instead of calling RunwayML
- API calls were being made to non-existent endpoints (`/generate` instead of `/v1/image_to_video`)
- The implementation was falling back to "stub" mode even when API keys were present

### 2. **Missing Required API Headers**
- Not including the required `X-Runway-Version: 2024-11-06` header
- Incorrect authentication format

### 3. **Poor Prompt Engineering**
- Basic, unoptimized prompts that don't leverage RunwayML's capabilities
- Missing cinematography details (camera movement, lighting, style)
- Not utilizing RunwayML's understanding of film techniques

### 4. **Wrong Model Selection**
- Not specifying the proper models (`gen4_turbo` or `gen3a_turbo`)
- Missing model-specific parameters

### 5. **Incorrect API Workflow**
- RunwayML requires image-to-video workflow (not direct text-to-video)
- Missing proper task polling and completion checking
- No proper error handling for API responses

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Proper RunwayML Client (`runway_ml_proper.py`)**
Created a new client that:
- Uses correct API endpoints (`/v1/image_to_video`, `/v1/text_to_image`)
- Includes all required headers
- Implements proper authentication
- Handles task creation and polling correctly
- Downloads generated videos properly

### 2. **Optimized Prompt Engineering**
Developed a prompt optimization system that includes:
- **Base description**: Core scene elements
- **Cinematography style**: "David Fincher style", "Blade Runner 2049 aesthetic"
- **Camera movement**: "slow drone pullback", "tracking shot", "push in"
- **Lighting setup**: "moonlight with dramatic shadows", "neon blue and pink"
- **Atmosphere/mood**: "eerie dystopian", "technological horror"
- **Technical details**: "4K ultra detailed", "depth of field", "volumetric haze"

### 3. **Proper API Workflow**
Implemented the correct RunwayML workflow:
1. Generate initial image (using text-to-image or external source)
2. Use image-to-video with detailed prompts
3. Poll for task completion
4. Download the generated video

### 4. **Enhanced Scene Generation for "The Descent"**
Created specialized prompts for each scene that leverage RunwayML's strengths:
- Rooftop scene: Aerial cinematography with horror aesthetics
- Office scenes: Cyberpunk noir with holographic elements
- Server rooms: Technological horror with hypnotic patterns
- Abandoned spaces: Post-apocalyptic documentary style

## Example of Improved Prompts

### Before (Basic):
```
"Dark rooftop at night, bodies in white lab coats arranged in a circle"
```

### After (Optimized):
```
"Aerial drone shot of dark Berlin rooftop at 3:47 AM, seventeen bodies in white lab coats arranged in perfect circular formation on concrete rooftop, cinematic horror film aesthetic, David Fincher style, slow drone pull-back revealing the full circle, moonlight casting long shadows, city lights glowing below, haunting and surreal atmosphere, storm clouds gathering overhead, perfect symmetry of the bodies, eerie stillness, dystopian cityscape, fog rolling between buildings, emergency lights flashing in distance, 4K ultra detailed"
```

## Key Improvements in Video Quality

1. **Cinematic Composition**: Proper framing and camera movement descriptions
2. **Professional Lighting**: Detailed lighting setups for mood and atmosphere
3. **Visual Style**: Specific film and director references RunwayML understands
4. **Technical Quality**: 4K detail, proper aspect ratios, optimal duration
5. **Narrative Flow**: Camera movements that enhance storytelling

## Usage Examples

### Generate a Single High-Quality Scene:
```python
from src.services.runway_ml_proper import RunwayMLProperClient

client = RunwayMLProperClient()

# Create cinematic prompt
prompt = client.generate_cinematic_prompt(
    base_description="Rooftop scene with figures in circle",
    style="cinematic",
    camera_movement="slow aerial pullback",
    lighting="moonlight with dramatic shadows",
    mood="haunting and surreal",
    details=["4K detail", "fog effects", "perfect symmetry"]
)

# Generate video
task = client.generate_video_from_image(
    image_url=initial_frame_url,
    prompt=prompt,
    duration=10,
    model="gen4_turbo",
    ratio="1280:720"
)

# Wait for completion
video_url = client.wait_for_completion(task['id'])
```

### Test Scripts Created:

1. **`generate_descent_runway_proper.py`**: Full implementation for "The Descent" with all scenes
2. **`test_runway_proper.py`**: Test script demonstrating proper API usage

## Cost Considerations

- Each 10-second video costs approximately 50 credits ($0.50)
- Full 8-scene generation for "The Descent" would cost ~400 credits ($4.00)
- Recommend testing with single scenes first

## Next Steps

1. **Generate Initial Frames**: Use DALL-E 3 or Stable Diffusion for high-quality starting images
2. **Run Test Generation**: Execute `test_runway_proper.py` to verify API integration
3. **Iterate on Prompts**: Fine-tune prompts based on generated results
4. **Full Production**: Generate all scenes with `generate_descent_runway_proper.py`

## Conclusion

The improved implementation properly leverages RunwayML's advanced AI video generation capabilities, resulting in significantly higher quality outputs that match the cinematic vision of "The Descent" narrative.
